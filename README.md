# An exercise on JPEG compression evaluation

This is an extended analysis of how JPEG compression is performed by Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, Flickr, Facebook, and Google. Done as the final project for the *Multimedia Systems* course I took at Ca'Foscari University of Venice, Master's degree in Computer Science.
