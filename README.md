# An exercise on JPEG compression evaluation

This is an extended analysis of how JPEG compression is performed by Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, Flickr, Facebook, and Google. Done as the final project for the *Multimedia Systems* course I took at Ca'Foscari University of Venice, Master's degree in Computer Science.

08/2021: I've just uploaded the presentation I did for this project - hooray! The power of cleaning up my laptop, I guess.
